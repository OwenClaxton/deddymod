# Tech++: Overhauling the Minecraft development experience.

This is a minecraft for 1.21.0 using Minecraft Forge.
I've added a selection of features to the game including:
- New ores to be found, mined, and processed
  - Plastimetal: Better than Iron, not as good as Netherite.
  - Tin: Common, like Copper.
  - Bronze: Forged from Copper and Tin.
- New metal processing:
  - Nuggets are now raw ore, and can be smelted into billets
    - 9x Nuggets -> Raw Metal
    - 9x Billets -> Ingot
  - Raw metal can still be smelted into ingots
    - 9x Raw Metal -> Raw Metal Block
    - 9x Ingots -> Metal Block
  - Raw Metal Blocks can now be smelted into Blocks of Metal
  - Heat matters - a kiln can only cook nuggets, and furnaces can't cook blocks!
- New armour and tools
  - Copper, Plastimetal, Tin, Bronze ...
- New surface items to be found and used
- New crafting method (carving):
  - Carve branches into handles for tools, and carve handles into spears.
- New crafting stations:
  - Crusher: Grind things down into their components. Smash sandstone into sand, or shatter stone into cobblestone.
  - Kiln: Entry-level furnace. Turn nuggets into billets.

My next steps on this mod is to rework the base game's tool use to slow down a player's progression.

## Disclaimer
I work on this mod in my free time to learn and develop my Java understanding and skills, and so progression may be slow or varied.
