# Tech++: Overhauling the Minecraft development experience.

This is a minecraft for 1.20.4 using Minecraft Forge.
I've added a selection of features to the game including:
- New ores to be found, mined, and processed
- New armour and tools
- New surface items to be found and used
- New crafting method (carving)

My next steps on this mod is to rework the base game's tool use to slow down a player's progression.

## Disclaimer
I work on this mod in my free time to learn and develop my Java understanding and skills, and so progression may be slow or varied.
